					<h3>3. Types of Data We Collect</h3>

					<p>“Personal Information” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.</p>
					<p>“Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

					<h4>a. Information You Provide to Us.</h4>
					<p>We may collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, phone number, and password when you create an account with us (“Account”).</p>
					<p>If you are a Designer, we may require that you provide your tax information (e.g., social security number).</p>
					<p>When you make a purchase, we (or our third party service provider) will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, debit card information, billing information and/or PayPal information.</p>
					<p>We retain information on your behalf, such as Design Briefs, Design Contests, Design Concepts, Design Templates, Invoice Service invoices, transactional history, messages and any other information that you store using your Account.</p>
					<p>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</p>
					<p>When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.</p>
					<p>When you post messages on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.</p>
					<p>We may also collect Personal Information at other points in our Site that state that Personal Information is being collected.</p>

					<h4>b. Information Collected via Technology.</h4>
					<p>To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information for the purposes of security and to detect fraudulent activity.</p>
					<p>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Cookies may enable automatic logins when you visit in the future and may enable content customization.</p>
					<p>We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our visitor’s Personal Information.</p>
					<p>The use of tracking technologies by our technology partners and other 3rd party assets on the Site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage content on our Site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our visitor’s Personal Information. We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

					<h4>c. Google Analytics.</h4>
					<p>We currently use Google Analytics as well as Google Analytics for Display Advertising. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. Website owners can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. Please see the following links for more information about Google Analytics:</p>
					<ul> 
						<li>http://www.google.com/analytics/</li> 
						<li>http://www.google.com/privacy.html</li>
						<li>http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html</li>
					</ul><p>
					<p>You can also opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by going to the Google Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
